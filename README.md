# Movie-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard
Introduction

The project focuses on analyzing the movie industry using interactive Power BI dashboards.
It explores multiple dimensions including genre, financial performance, and audience engagement.

Dashboards are segmented into:

● Genre Analysis
 
● Financial Analysis

● Audience Analysis

The dataset includes key attributes such as movie count, revenue, budget, profit, IMDb ratings, Rotten Tomatoes scores, directors, production companies, release year, language, and MPAA ratings.

Problem Statement

With thousands of movies released globally, stakeholders struggle to understand:

● Which genres perform best in terms of revenue and critical reception.

● Which directors and production companies generate the most profit.

● How audience preferences vary across ratings, languages, and release years.

The goal is to enable data-driven decisions for production, marketing, and distribution in the film industry.
